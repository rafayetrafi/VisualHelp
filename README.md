# ObjectDetector
An android app which enables the blind people to get information about their surroundings. 
The app identifies the objects which are pointed by the camera and on tapping the object (or bounding box surrounding the object), a voice is generated identifying the object and thus delivering an idea about the location of the object to the user. It uses the ssd_mobilenet_v1 architecture for object detection. 
The model is saved as a .tflite file in the assets folder along with the labels
